- start from a non multithreading tag

- discuss slow performance of such approach
- discuss bottlenecks
- discuss entities/roles: producer, consumer, middle tier - broker

- PRODUCER:
- add a few producer threads written ad-hoc that submit
  messages to the broker
- demonstrate race condition
- Vocabulary: thread function/functor/lambda

- BROKER:
- guard access to the synchronous dispatch loop
- race condition is eliminated
- Vocabulary: mutex

- CONSUMER:
- decouple consumer internally - TODO
- add a message queue and a consumption loop using polling
- demonstrate more performance
- Vocabulary: mutex, polling

- CONSUMER:
- replace polling by a condition variable
- Vocabulary: condition_variable

- BROKER:
- further decoupling:
        - subscribe/unsubscribe queue
        - message queue
        - worker thread

Vocabulary still to be covered:
- async/future/promise
- deadlock
